# Windows 10 Spotlite to Wallpaper

### <u>Work</u>:

This script copies files, (which are more than 200KB in size and not older than 3 days) from Windows 10 spotlite folder to a specific folder.  
As the copied files are not with image extension, it also renames the files with .jpeg extension.

### <u>Modification / Setup</u>:

Destination folder is set to: <i>H:\walpaper\x</i>  
Change it with your folder location, where the images will be saved.
