# File Renamer

I have a bunch of file with date in their names  
eg: 2020_01_13_123510_file.php  
Need to update the date of all the files using a pattern

---

Instruction:  
put this script in the _Folder_ where the files are kept  
_folder_ should only have the files that need reenamimg and this script
